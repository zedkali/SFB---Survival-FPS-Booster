SFB - Survival FPS Booster
Hello! You probably know how it is — you're playing your favorite hardcore survival sandbox game, you enter a big city, and your FPS drops so low that you want to cry. Trees are rendered right in front of your nose, zombies twitch, and in PvP, it's not skill that decides everything, but lag.

This little utility is the result of my many days of experimenting with settings. I've put together everything that really helped me squeeze extra frames out of the engine without losing gameplay quality. It's not magic, just competent optimization.

What's in it?
Smart rendering settings: The right parameters for rendering objects and grass so as not to overload the video card where it's not needed.
Cache cleaning: Helps remove micro-stutters that accumulate during long gameplay sessions.
Optimal presets: Not just “low/medium/ultra,” but balanced profiles for different graphics cards — so it looks good but runs smoothly.
Safe backup: Before applying any changes, a backup copy of your original configurations is created. Rolling back is just one button away.

What is NOT here?
No cheating, hacking, or license violations. We simply tweak what is already available in the game files.
No malicious code. The source code (where possible) is available for you to review.
Guaranteed +100500 FPS. It all depends on your hardware, but you will definitely see an increase, especially on low-end and mid-range systems.

How to use it?
1. Download the latest release.

2. Run as administrator (required to work with files in the game folder).

3. Select your hardware profile in the program.

4. Click “Apply” and restart the game.

5. Enjoy a smoother Chernarus!

If it helped, give the repository a star. If you have ideas for improvement, create an issue or pull request. Good luck surviving!


P.S. This thing is made for personal use and testing on a clean version of the game. If you have tons of mods installed, the results may vary.
